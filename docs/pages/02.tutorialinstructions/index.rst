Usage notes: Multimodal lesion mapping in focal epilepsy with z-brains
======================================================================

| **Z-BRAINS** is developed by `MICA-Lab <https://mica-mni.github.io>`_, affiliated with `McGill University <https://www.mcgill.ca/>`_, 
		the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital (`The Neuro <https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/>`_), and the McConnell Brain Imaging Center (`BIC <https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/>`_).

| This open access processing and analysis tool aims identify patient-specific anomalies in brain morphology and microstructure, 
		using features with previously demonstrated potential to accurately localize epileptogenic lesions. 
		
| **Z-BRAINS** uses a set of known software dependencies developped by other groups and aggregated in a published pipeline, `micapipe <https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micapipe>`_.

| **Z-BRAINS** includes a set of tools accompanied by validated, ready-to-use, and easy-to-follow code snippets. 
        These code snippets will guide you through each analysis step.
