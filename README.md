## Multimodal lesion mapping in focal epilepsy with `z-brains` ##

`z-brains` is developed by [MICA-lab](https://mica-mni.github.io), affiliated with [McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/), the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital "[the Neuro](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/)", and the McConnell Brain Imaging Center ([BIC](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/)). 

This open access processing and analysis tool aims identify patient-specific anomalies in brain morphology and microstructure, using features with previously demonstrated potential to accurately localize epileptogenic lesions. 

`z-brains` uses a set of known software dependencies developped by other groups and aggregated in a published pipeline [micapipe](https://github.com/MICA-MNI/micapipe).
